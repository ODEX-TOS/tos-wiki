All these keybindings will be about the Tiling Window manager. Of course there are more keybindings in specific applications. Those will not be covered here.

The mod key equals your windows key.

Floating mode is the mode where applications are "free" from the tiling paradigm. The can have the resolution they want and you can move them freely. Much like the traditional window managers do.
All you need to do to enable this mode is use `mod+c`
