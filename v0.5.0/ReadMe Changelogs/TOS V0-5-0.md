The 0.5.0 version brings quite the UI overhaul.

We migrated from `i3` to `awesome` for better widget support.
Now users who aren't familiar with the keyboard driven nature can still use the operating system.

### Installer
We have migrated from our own gui installer to `calamares` since more people find this installer usable.

### compositor
We have changed the way our compositor composits windows. Now all (except a few) windows will have the kawase blur applied.

### Login manager
Instead of directly booting into the window manager we added a login manager. Here you will first have to login into your account before starting the window manager.

And numerous bug fixes have been applied.
