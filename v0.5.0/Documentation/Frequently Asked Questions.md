## What is the difference between all versions?

We currently have 3 different versions. The big difference between versions is the server/GUI image.
We serve a server edition which should not be used by the general public. We also provide GUI images. Currently there are 2 versions `toslive` and `toslive-awesome`. If you don't know what to pick we recommend `toslive-awesome` as this image is currently beeing used. The `toslive` image is there for legacy purposes. It was used in the alpha release.

## Why should I choose TOS above another distribution?

TOS is a distribution for the more advanced linux users. Most of those users use Operating systems like `Arch Linux, Debian or gentoo` however installing and configuring these distributions can take quite a bit of time. TOS helps these people save time by doing all that for them. While still giving them the power they would have gotten if they used those systems.

## Why should I prefer TOS above something like manjaro?

This is your own preference but we don't like it that `manjaro` uses there own repositories (And we find them in most cases inferior to the arch repo's) Above all that manjaro tries to be a Distribution that is save and easy to use. However it is still a rolling release (which is a weird design choice)
We think that what manjaro tries to do is a bad choice in terms of technical solutions.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't use them. This is just our personal preference.
